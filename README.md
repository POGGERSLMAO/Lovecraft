It was a lonely night for Elliot
As per normal
He sat alone in his dark room
He hears a couple footsteps outside and he gets curious
He moves to his window to check the situation out
It seems that he is not alone anymore
Its Eric
Eric earlier told him on discord that he was gonna come with a KNIFE
*Elliot gets shook*
Elliot doesn't know what to do anymore
Elliot locks himself in his room and sits there quietly.
SUDDENLY
A door openes
He hears the breathing from erics THICC mouth
eric wanders around in the room searching for Elliot
Eric hears a low whisper from something outside. 
*Eric goes to check*
Eric is SHOOK
He sees Hampus
Hampus has told him earlier in discord that he was doing to follow him home and then proceed to kill him with a rusty dirty old 90year old dirty cheesy knife
Eric is confused 
Eric proceeds to hide in the same spot as Elliot (somehow)
Elliot and Eric claims eye domination over eachother 
Its love at first sight 
They both hear the mumbling from Hampus
HE IS FULL OF ANGER
Hampus proceeds to enter the Room
Hampus doesnt know here anyone is BUT he knows they are here
Hampus proceeds to check every step of the way 
Hampus has forgotten one place where Elliot and Eric is 
Elliot and Eric is hidnig in a closet 
Hampus licks the rusty knife, he is ready for murder
Hampus furiously opens the door to the closet
Inside they see 2 young males that are full of fear
Hampus takes great pleasure in looking them into the eye with the rusty knife.

End of story
